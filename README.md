# JBoss BRMS 6 Workshop

This is a workshop for JBoss BRMS 6. It provides an introduction into the core concepts, APIs, etc. The workshop comes with a series of labs that mainly focus on rule authoring, and try 
to address various Drools Rule Language constructs and concepts (e.g. salience, agenda-groups, ruleflow-groups, lock-on-active, etc.). They take a novice user of the platform from a set of 
simple rules to more complex constructs through a series of lab exercises that gradually introduce new concepts and gradually increase complexity.
